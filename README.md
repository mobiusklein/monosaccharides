Monosaccharides
---------------

There are thousands of possible monosaccharides, but their chemical formulae are not unique. In order
to standardize the names of monosaccharides used across different glycomics and glycoproteomics software,
we propose a short list of common monosaccharides that can be used to cover the majority of mammalian *N*-
and *O*-linked glycans.
